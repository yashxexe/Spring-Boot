# Spring-Boot-Projects 
The project is a web application built using Rest Spring Boot that serves as an API for a Banking System Management.
The application has various endpoints that allow users to view products, add products to their cart, and place orders.
The endpoints are built using Rest Spring Boot and are exposed through HTTP requests.
Postman is used as a tool to test the various endpoints and ensure that the application is working as expected.
The application is designed to be scalable and can handle a large number of users and requests.
The codebase is structured in a modular way, with separate modules for each endpoint and database operations.
The application uses MySQL as the database and is configured using Spring Data JPA.
The endpoints are secured using Spring Security and require users to authenticate before making any requests.
